  "description": "CryptOrchid seeds are ready for germination! When you germinate a seed, you'll get a single flower of a random species - visit the CryptOrchids website to learn more about the CryptOrchids genum. Germinating a seed starts the game - you'll need to water your newly planted flower exactly every 7 days, so be sure to germinate at a convenient day and time for your schedule!",
