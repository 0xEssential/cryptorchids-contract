# CryptOrchids Contract

This repo contains the Solidity smart contract code for [CryptOrchids](https://cryptorchids.io), the NFT based game where CryptOrchid growers must water their flower every 7 days, or else it dies and cannot be sold, destroying it's secondary market value.

The best place to verify the code is via Etherscan. The [CryptOrchids website](https://cryptorchids.io) has a footer link to the contract on Etherscan where the source code has been uploaded and validated. Follow that link to ensure you are viewing the right repository - the same contract address used in the footer is the contract you interact with on the CryptOrchids website.

This repository exists primarily to maintain an open ethos, but we also felt it was important to show the test suite for the contract such that players can be assured that the game functions as we describe.

See the test suite at [test/CryptOrchidERC721.test.ts](/test/CryptOrchidERC721.test.ts). You can also verify that they run and pass under the Actions tab.
